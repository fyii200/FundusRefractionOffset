#### Note
*An embargo period of no more than 1 year from the date of publication (June 5, 2025) will apply before the deep learning model weights are made publicly available on this repo. Interested researchers are encouraged to contact Fabian Yii (fabian.yii@ed.ac.uk or fslyii@hotmail.com) directly to discuss potential collaborations and the sharing of model weights during the embargo period.*
